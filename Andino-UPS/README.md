## Overview

Andino UPS is an Uninterruptible Power Supply for 24 Volt DC Client Devices.
It stores the Energy in long lasting Supercaps instead of Lead- or Lithium Batteries.
Depending on the environment temperature, the lifetime can reach up to 10 years without any maintenance. 

This UPS is designed for industrial PLC and other devices powered with 24 V DC.
It is intended to allow the client device to bridge over short voltage drops and, in the event of a prolonged power failure, to shut down in a controlled manner. Thus, the controlled device can close databases, connections and synchronize the file system without the risk of data loss.

The Andino UPS has an 24V DC Input and a 24V DC Output. 
This reduce the Energy loos for the conversion to mains power and backwards.

The UPS can deliver up to 10 Watts or 0,4 Ampere at 24 Volts.
